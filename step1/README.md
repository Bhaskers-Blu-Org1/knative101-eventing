# Link a service to an Event importer

Event sources in Knative are defined by Kubernetes Custom Resources. There are a list of predefined event sources in Knative. Creating an event source importer and using `SINK` to link to a Knative service is the simpliest way to consume an event. Here we use `Cronjob` as a sample.

## 1. Create a Knative service `event-display`

Firstly, we create a Knative service `event-display` by:

```text
kubectl apply --filename service.yaml 
```

Expected output:
```
Service 'event-display' successfully created in namespace 'default'.
```

Run below command and check if the status `READY` of this Knative service is `True`:

```text
kubectl get ksvc
```

Expected outputï¼š
```
NAME            DOMAIN                                                                   GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
event-display   event-display-default.knative1-guoyc.au-syd.containers.appdomain.cloud   1            32s   3 OK / 3     True
```

## 2. Create a CronJobSource

CronJobSource is a predefined event source which uses an in-memory timer to produce events on the specified Cron schedule.

1. Create a cron job

    Review the content of `cronjob.yaml`, which describes a definition of a cron job:
    ```text
    cat cronjob.yaml
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    apiVersion: sources.eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: CronJobSource
    metadata:
    name: cronjobs
    spec:
      schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
      data: "{\"message\": \"Hello world!\"}"
      sink:
        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Service
        name: event-display
    ```

    There are three parameters in the `spec` of a CronJobSource:
    - schedule: a cron format string. Here `"*/1 * * * *"` means every minute
    - data: the data to be posted to the target, in CloudEvent format.
    - sink: the URI messages will be forwarded on to. Here we use `event-display`, which is the Knative service we just created.

    Create the CronJobSource `cronjobs` by running below command:

    ```text
    kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/cronjobs created
    ```
    
2. Check if the cron job is created by running:

    ```text
    kubectl get cronjobsource
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    NAME       AGE
    cronjobs   44s
    ```

## 3. Look at the logs of `event-display`

The event source `cronjobs` will send a event message to `event-display` every minute. `event-display` will print the message to logs. You can check the running pods on Kubernetes.

1. List running Pods by:

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cronjob-cronjobs-tlzm9-7d4f79bbc8-krb8q           1/1     Running   0          98s
    event-display-46hhp-deployment-597487d855-7ctj5   2/2     Running   0          37s
    ```

    The pod named as `cronjob-cronjobs-*` is the cron job event source. The pod named as `event-display-*` is the Knative service `event-display` which will print event message to logs.

2. Check the logs of `event-display` by:

    ```
    kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods --selector=serving.knative.dev/configuration=event-display --output=jsonpath="{.items..metadata.name}") user-container
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    _  CloudEvent: valid _
    Context Attributes,
    SpecVersion: 0.2
    Type: dev.knative.cronjob.event
    Source: /apis/v1/namespaces/default/cronjobsources/cronjobs
    ID: 1e269ba0-114f-41d6-a889-dcdebaa0a73d
    Time: 2019-06-20T14:23:00.000371555Z
    ContentType: application/json
    Transport Context,
    URI: /
    Host: event-display.default.svc.cluster.local
    Method: POST
    Data,
    {
        "message": "Hello world!"
    }
    ```
    It shows that Knative service `event-display` gets event messages sent from CronJobSource `cronjobs`.

    Terminate this process by `ctrl + c`.

## 4. Delete event source

Use below command to delete `cronjobs`:

```
kubectl delete -f cronjob.yaml
```

Expected output:
```
cronjobsource.sources.eventing.knative.dev "cronjobs" deleted
```

We don't delete Knative service `event-display` because we will use it in the following labs.
